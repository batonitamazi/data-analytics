# data-analytics
Hello dear reader, in this repository I saved my quizz files for data analytics class in university.

in this files you can see sklearn library models which are linearRegression, LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier methods and other classification methods.
I used that models to predict the housing prices according to some dataset from kaggle which is provided in here also.
